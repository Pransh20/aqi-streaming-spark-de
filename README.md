# Air Quality Streaming Analytics for Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

**Real-time, region-aware analytics pipeline with Kafka, Spark Structured Streaming, and geospatial enrichment.**

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a production-grade data engineering workflow:

- Ingests live air quality data from [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/).
- Streams, parses, and enriches events in real time with Apache Kafka and PySpark.
- Assigns each air quality measurement to its German Bundesland (state) using geospatial lookup.
- Performs rolling window aggregations to surface the regions with the best and worst air qualityâ€”**live**.

**Why?**  
To showcase end-to-end data engineering skillsâ€”from data ingestion, streaming, and enrichment, to real-time analytics and geospatial processing. Suitable for technical interviews, portfolio reviews, and as a practical reference for scalable streaming solutions.

## Features

- **Open-source data ingestion:** Pulls latest air quality metrics (PM2.5, PM10, NO2) from OpenAQ for Germany.
- **Streaming pipeline:** Uses Apache Kafka for robust data transport.
- **Real-time transformation:** Spark Structured Streaming parses, explodes, and cleans JSON events.
- **Geospatial enrichment:** Each event is mapped to its German Bundesland (state) by nearest centroid lookup (using a GeoPandas-generated lookup table).
- **Windowed aggregation:** 5-minute rolling averages per region and pollutant.
- **Streaming analytics output:** Prints regional trends to the console, ready for downstream dashboards or storage.
- **Extensible:** Easily adaptable to point-in-polygon mapping, external databases, or visualization frameworks.
